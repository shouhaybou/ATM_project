# ATM_project
This project was for my software engineering class.
Below is my own prompt that I created it :
The mayor of a city in Senegal, Africa came to my company to find a solution about how he can have ATM money dispensers in all around the city.
Thereâ€™s only one bank in the entire city and to make it easier for people, he asks me to create an ATM software where people can come withdraw, 
and deposit money or check without having to drive miles and miles to the central bank.
People will have to put their pin to use the machine.
People must have a card to insert into the machine
A screen that displays all the options that an ATM needs.
